# Overview

**iSpy** is an interactive dashboard created using **Dash**, a python framework
written on the top of **Flask**, **Plotly.js** and **React.js**. The dashboard
allows users to interactively create a metadata and config file for
Influenza Genome and SARS-CoV-2 Spike-Gene Assembly. Subsequently, it
will generate the files necessary to upload via FTP to NCBIâ€™s databases
**Genbank**, **BioSample**, and **SRA**, as well as **GISAID**.

Below is a flowchart diagram that illustrates the process of Influenza genome and SARS-CoV-2 spike-gene assembly and curation. In generality, the process starts with demultiplexed sequencing reads from an Illumina or Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencer and finish with high quality genomes ready for submission to public repositories.
